**java i/o tutorial**

```text

Java I/O is used to process the input and produce the output.

Java uses the concepts of a stream to make I/O operation fast, the java.io package contains all the classes required for 
input and output operations

we can perform file handling in java by java i/o api

```

**Stream**

```text

a stream is a sequence of data. in java. a stream is composed of bytes. it's called a stream because it is like a

stream of water that continues to flow.

```

in java. 3 streams are created for us automatically, all these streams are attached with consoleã€‚

- System.out: standard output stream
- System.in : standard output stream
- System.err: standard output stream

let's see the code to print output and an error message to the console

```text

System.out.println("simple message");  
System.err.println("error message");  

```

let's see the code to get input from console

```text

int i=System.in.read();//returns ASCII code of 1st character  
System.out.println((char)i);//will print the character  

```
